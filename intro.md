Note:

Hi! I'm Matt Parsons.
So this is me on the internet, and now I'm me in real life.
I've been writing Haskell for about three years now professionally.
I'm going to be sharing some of the insights and experiences I've had with error handling in Haskell.


# boom!

- What are exceptions?
- How can we handle them effectively?
- What non-exceptional ways can we write programs?

Note:

We're going to learn about exceptions, how to handle them when we must, and how to avoid them when we can.
